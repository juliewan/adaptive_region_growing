## Minimally Interactive Seeded Adaptive Region Growing Image Segmentation
###### CAP5415 Fall 2021 Term Project

Interactive image segmentation can ill-perform extraction in spite of human seeing guidance owed to inflexible growing principle. Many semi-automatic segmentation methods invoke further assistance in refining desired segmentation, evincing them as less automatic in practice. I ascertained the efficacy of an adaptive region growing method that models the homogeneity criterion of the to-be-segmented region beforehand. Seeded region growing is performed twice, initially leniently and exploratorily, and then focusedly, pressurized by self-learned homogeneity parameters. My determination is that semi-automatic segmentation with adaptive region growing is more precocious, resulting in more fulfilling intraregional connectivity and objectness contouring with less interaction. Further work remains to be done in tailoring the exploration stage to accommodate advanced shapes and boundary and size limitations.
