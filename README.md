## Minimally Interactive Seeded Adaptive Region Growing Image Segmentation
###### CAP5415 Fall 2021 Term Project

Interactive segmentation can perform suboptimally despite human seeing guidance due to an inflexible growth principle. Semi-automatic segmentation methods typically invoke further assistance in refining desired segmentation, evincing them as more manual than automatic in practice. I ascertained the efficacy of an adaptive region growing strategy that models the homogeneity criterion of the to-be-segmented region beforehand. Seeded region growing is performed twice, initially exploratorily, and then focusedly, pressurized by self-learned homogeneity parameters. My determination is that semi-automatic segmentation with adaptive region growing is more precocious, resulting in more fulfilling intraregional connectivity and objectness contouring with lesser interaction. Further work remains to be done in tailoring the exploration stage to accommodate advanced shapes and boundary and size limitations.
